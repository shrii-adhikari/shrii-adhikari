👋 Hi, I’m @shrii-adhikari

🎓 I’m currently pursuing my Masters in Data Science at The University of Sheffield (TUoS).

👀 I’m passionate about data science, machine learning, and their applications in solving real-world problems, especially in public services and policymaking.

🌱 I’m currently working on projects that explore predictive modelling, sentiment analysis, and data visualisation techniques to derive actionable insights.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving AI for social good, clickbait detection, resource allocation, and open data analytics.

🛠️ My technical skills include Python, R, SPSS, Tableau, and expertise in statistical analysis, data cleaning, and creating compelling visualisations.
